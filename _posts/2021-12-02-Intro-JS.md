# Basics of JavaScript

## Setup

[Downloading NodeJS on WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl)

* Install cURL (a tool used for downloading content from the internet in the command-line) with: `sudo apt-get install curl`

* Install nvm, with: `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash`

* To verify installation, enter: `command -v nvm` ...this should return 'nvm', if you receive 'command not found' or no response at all, close your current terminal, reopen it, and try again. Learn more in the nvm github repo

* Install the latest stable LTS release of Node.js (recommended): `nvm install --lts`

* List what versions of Node are installed: `nvm ls`

* Verify that Node.js is installed and the currently default version with: `node --version`. Then verify that you have npm as well, with: `npm --version` (You can also use which node or which npm to see the path used for the default versions).

## Hello Javascript

```js
console.log('Hello Javascript');
> Hello Javascript
```


```js
var someVariable = 'Hello Javascript';
console.log(someVariable);
> Hello Javascript
```

## Variables
Java Script 3 major data types:
* number 
* string 
* boolean

```js
var fullName = 'ThisIsMyName';
console.log(fullName, typeOf fullName);
> ThisIsMyName string

var amICorrect = true;
console.log(amICorrect, typeOf amICorrect);
> true boolean

var myNumber = 47;
console.log(myNumber, typeOf myNumber);
> 47 number
```

The variables which are defined using `var` are given `undefined` as value, until they are assigned a value. This is done in the `Memory Creation` phase. Which we will be coming across in the future posts.

```js
var noVar;
console.log(noVar);
>>> undefined
noVar = "I'm not a variable";
console.log(noVar);
>>> I'm not a variable
```

We can take input from the user, for example in the browser we can use the `prompt` function to create a pop-up box, where the user can enter a value.
```js
var takeInput;
takeInput = prompt("Give me some Input"); 
```

For printing the varialbes in between string data and which is a multi-line we can use the interpolation. Notice how we are using backtick symbol to denote the start of the string and the backtick symbol again to denote the end of the string. And to have any varialbe we can use `${variable_name}`. 

```js
console.log(`
    This is a multi-line
    string.
    Where I can even call
    variables. like ${fullName}
    and ${myNumber}.
`)

>>>
    This is a multi-line
    string.
    Where I can even call
    variables. like ThisIsMyName
    and 47.
```

## Operators

We can use `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` to perform arithmetic operations.

```js
var listPrice = 799
var salePrice = 199
var discount = ( (listPrice - salePrice)/listPrice ) * 100;
console.log(`${discount}%`);
>>> 75.09386733416771%
```

The asnwer which has so many decimal points can be made clean by using `round` functin from `Math`.

```js
displayDiscount = Math.round(discount);
console.log(`${displayDiscount}%`);
>>> 75%
```

> Operator Precedence can be best understand from [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence)

## Conditionals

```js
if (' ') console.log('This is True');
>>> This is True

if (1) console.log('This is True');
>>> This is True

if ('FALSE') console.log('This is True');
>>> This is True

if (true) console.log('This is True');
>>> This is True

if (false) console.log('This is NOT going to be Printed');
>>>

if (0) console.log('This is NOT going to be Printed');
>>>

if ('') console.log('This is NOT going to be Printed');
>>>

if (null) console.log('This is NOT going to be Printed');
>>>

if (0) console.log('This is NOT going to be Printed');
>>>

var iAmGoingToBeUndefined;
if (iAmGoingToBeUndefined) console.log('This is NOT going to be Printed');
>>>

var someArray = []; // new Array()
if (someArray) console.log('This is True');
>>> This is True

var someObject = {}; // new Object()
if (someObject) console.log('This is True');
>>> This is True
```

The `if` condition will be evaluated and run the code inside the block if the condition is true. So to run the code of `if` block the condition must be `Truthy`.

In JavaScript, `0`, `false`, `''`,  `null`, `NaN`, `undefined` are `Falsy` values.  
Remaining everything else is `Truthy`.

## Nested ifs and Logical Operators.

```js
var isEmployee = true;
var isLoggenIn = true;
var isAdmin = true;

if (isEmployee) {
    if (isLoggenIn) {
        if (isAdmin) {
            console.log('Welcome Mr. Adminva');
        }
    }
}
>>> Welcome Mr. Adminva
```
The content will be printed only if `all` the three are true. But there is a better approach using `Logical AND (&&)` operator.

```js
if (isEmployee && isLoggenIn && isAdmin) {
    console.log('Welcome Mr. Adminva');
}
else {
    console.log('You are not authorized');
}
>>> Welcome Mr. Adminva
```

Similary if we want to pass the condition if `any` of the condition is true, then 
we use `Logical OR(||)` operator.

```js
var isMom = false;
var isDad = false;
var isSister = true;

if (isMom || isDad || isSister) {
    console.log('You are a family member');
}
else {
    console.log('Kaun hai miya tum??r');
}
>>> You are a family member
```

## Ternery Operator

The ternery operator `?` whatever is before, if evaluated to `true` first expression is executed, otherwise the second expression is executed.
> Syntax: `condition ? expression1 : expression2`

```js
var authenticated = true;

if (authenticated) {
    console.log('Welcome');
}
else {
    console.log('Show login Options');
}
>>> Welcome

// Alternate shorted approach
console.log(authenticated ? 'Welcome' : 'Show login Options');
>>> Welcome
```
## Switch and Case
The `switch` statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

Given a value, the `switch` statement evaluates the value and executes the code block(`case`) corresponding to the value.

```js
var userType = 'Analyst';

switch (userType) {
    case 'Manager':
        console.log('Welcome Manager');
        break;
    case 'Admin':
        console.log('Welcome Admin');
        break;
    case 'Developer':
        console.log('Welcome Developer');
        break;
    case 'Tester':
        console.log('Welcome Tester');
        break;
    case 'Analyst':
        console.log('Welcome Analyst');
        break;
    default:
        console.log('Welcome');
}
>>> Welcome Analyst
```
If we look carefully, we have a `break` after each case, because we want to stop the execution of the code block after the case is executed. If we don't have the break statement, the code block will be executed for all the cases which are the below the current case.

## Type Coercion

```js
console.log("2" + 2);
>>> 22
```
ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ Whattttttttt...

Java Scripts does `type coercion` which is convert one data type to another automatically when it faces any issue with the statement. Like in above example adding a `string` and a `number` is not possible, so JS automatically converts the `number` to `string` and concatenates the two.

```js
var user = 2;
if (user == "2"){
    console.log('Condition should be false, but........');
}
>>> Condition should be false, but........ 
```

As discussed, here JavaScript does `type coercion` and convertes user which is number 2 to string "2". So the condition is `true`.

We can avoid this by using `===` operator.
```js
var user = 2;
if (user === "2"){
    console.log('Condition should be false, but........');
}
>>>
```
